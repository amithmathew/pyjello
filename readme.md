# PyJello - A Simple Static Site Generator

## Introduction
PyJello was the fruit(haha!) of Python wielded in anger. I wanted a simple static site generator, that could handle static files without fuss, support Jinja2 and allow me to use MarkDown. I found Pelican unwieldy and too opiniated, and let's not even talk about Hugo. I decided that it made more sense to spend countless hours building my own framework than learning to use Pelican or Hugo, obviously.

## Features
PyJello is extremely simple and configurable. 
* Great support for Static Files
* Build your templates in Jinja2
* Write your posts with Markdown.
* Meta-attribute support in Markdown.
* Supports any ordering in your index files - completely customizable.
* Supports multiple "article-lists" at multiple paths.

## Versioning and Testing
We are too cool for any of these. I will be building out `unittest` cases soon. No, seriously.

## See it in action.
